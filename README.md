In April 2024 I permanently relocated to Brisbane from Auckland, New Zealand. I am continuing to work remotely with my New Zealand employer until I find a suitable role in Australia. I am a self motivated, recent graduate specialising in software development, with some industry experience. I'm passionate about user-centric design and innovative solutions. Analytical, observant, effective communicator and willing to learn.
